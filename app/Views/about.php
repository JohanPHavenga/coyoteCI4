            <p>Thank you for using my site and clicking on the About section to find out more about me. I'm flattered.</p>
            <p>Name is Johan Havenga. Nice to meet you. <b>Part time web developer, part time runner</b> with a full-time job. (that is not running this website).
                Hopefully one day that dream can become a reality. Cape Town is where I call home.</p>
            <p>This site started as an idea way back in 2015. It was born out of a frustration to find quality information on racing events in one place,
                across the regions where I live. At the time something like that did not exist, so I started building it from scratch in my spare time.
                By the end of 2016 I was ready to launch and so <a href="https://www.roadrunning.co.za/">RoadRunning.co.za</a> was born!</p>
            <p>Feel free to contact me should you have any suggestions or constuctive criticism.
            </p>
            <p>Happy running.
                <br>- Johan
