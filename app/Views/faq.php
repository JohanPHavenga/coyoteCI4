                            Races that are ran under the rules and regulations of the ASA (10km+) requires you to have a running license. You can either
                            buy a temporarily license for the race you want to enter, or join a running club and purchase a permanent license number for the year.
                            If you run more that 3x 10km+ races a year, it starts making financial sense to get a permanent number.

                            No we are not. In fact, we do not organise any events. All the events are organisers by different clubs and other event organisers.
                            We gather the information from everyone and post the events in a uniform manner.

                            It depends on the event, especially the size of the event. The smaller races will only do on-the-day entries. The really big
                            events will again only do online entries to ease the admin and make sure tracking chips are registered correctly.
                            Please make sure you read the information around entries and registration carefully to avoid disappointment.
